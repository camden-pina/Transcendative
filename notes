# Building targets with type x86_64-bios require creating ramdisk with grub-mkrescue in
# the root Makefile. This forces grub to be installed to the ramdisk and may override the
# intent.

# Status: Warning
# Building targets of type x86_64-uefi globaly still utilizes the depreciated
# grub-mkrescue method. It is posssible to build this target with a custom ramdisk, but
# only within its sub-directory Makefile.

# Status: Critical Error
# Continuity errors found. The ramdisk for both targets x86_64-bios and x86_64-uefi are
# created utilizing the depreciated grub-mkrescue method. It is possible for x86_64-uefi
# to create a custom ramdisk without grub installed. This is only handled within the
# sub-directory Makefile.
# Each ramdisk creation should occur in one of two ways:
# 1. The ramdisk is created and populated within the sub-directory Makefile. This
# eliminates the need for a /root/build/isofiles directory and that was only used by
# grub-mkrescue. Each ramdisk will follow a naming scheme so the root Makefile can easily
# locate it.
# 2. The ramdisk is created within the root Makefile, and populated from within the
# sub-directory Makefile. This abstracts the process by making the ramdisk creation
# global since it will be used by any foreseeable architecture.
